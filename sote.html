<p>My friends Aashna, Tuesha, and Arnav (Not really) are very annoying. I have many friends apart from these people but these kids are very annoying specially. Aashna requested me to make a specific page where I write things about us.</p>

<li>Tuesha: Calls herself a monkey, never completes her work.</li>

<li>Aashna: Good at art. Bad at studying.</li>

<li>Arnav: Very stubborn.</li>
<p>These people are very serious about thier play including me which is called "A Mad tea party" (except Arnav) instead of Arnav we have Rithvik becuase Arnav was acting like a 愚か者 but still he was good (niche se). Enough about Arnav. Now lets come on to Tuesha. Tuesha is a mysterious human being who possesses idiotic energy everytime. Thats it. Tuesha has nothing much to be talked about. Now onto Aashna. She got 44 in maths. Wow. This achievement is special because she can now take PCM as her stream</p>

    <summary>The idiotic energy</summary>

    <p>This energy known as the "Idiotic Energy" was first seen in possession by Tuesha Singh. This energy is capable of making any human being — wheather he/she is smart, cool, rich, poor — it makes them act like an idiot.</p>

  <summary>Arnav and the March hare</summary>

  <p>Ever since, Arnav has been removed from the role of March hare... he is showing great hate towards the team. This is a problematic thing becuase he is doing every thing to make us suffer. At this point I have no right so say anything bad about him but he was such a good guy before and now he just fighting with everyone.</p>
