		<h2>wFriends - Rithvik</h2>
		
	<p>Rithvik is an ideal student who is a big Naruto fan. He won the March Hare role over Arnav which is a big achievement! He is also a new student but with a lot more potential than others (especially Tuesha). With that, of course he has some bad sides too. He talks too much in class and is nearly Divij's Best friend. He sits with Divij and everyday he is doing just gossip with him.</p>
