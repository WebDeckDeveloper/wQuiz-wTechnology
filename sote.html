<p>My friends Aashna, Tuesha, and Arnav (Not really) are very annoying. I have many friends apart from these people but these kids are very annoying specially. Aashna requested me to make a specific page where I write things about us.</p>

<li>Tuesha: Calls herself a monkey, never completes her work.</li>

<li>Aashna: Good at art. Bad at studying.</li>

<li>Arnav: Very stubborn.</li>
<p>These people are very serious about thier play including me which is called "A Mad tea party" (except Arnav) instead of Arnav we have Rithvik becuase Arnav was acting like a 愚か者 but still he was good (niche se). Enough about Arnav. Now lets come on to Tuesha. Tuesha is a mysterious human being who possesses idiotic energy everytime. Thats it. Tuesha has nothing much to be talked about. Now onto Aashna. She got 44 in maths. Wow. This achievement is special because she can now take PCM as her stream</p>

<p>I will updatw this page later. For now go to</p> <a href="index.html">Home page</a>
